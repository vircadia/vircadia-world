# Caddy

We recommend using Caddy as a reverse proxy for the Vircadia World.

You should expose:

1. The API Manager for Vircadia World to the public internet.
2. The client to the public internet if you use the production client Docker deployment.

Exposing the client to the public internet is optional, but it's necessary if you use the production client Docker deployment that is included.

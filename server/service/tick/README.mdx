# World Tick Manager

The World Tick Manager is in charge of tracking changes in the world at fixed intervals to enable advanced features such as anti-cheat, lag compensation, and more. 

This is defined via sync groups located in the [auth schema](/vircadia-world/cli/database/migration/#2-auth). The ticks are tracked and managed in the [tick schema](/vircadia-world/cli/database/migration/#5-tick).

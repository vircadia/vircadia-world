# World State Manager

:::warning

This feature is currently in development and has not been validated for production use yet.

:::

The World State Manager is in charge of tracking changes in the world at fixed intervals to enable advanced features such as anti-cheat, lag compensation, and more. 

This is defined via sync groups located in the [auth schema](/vircadia-world/cli/database/migration/#2-auth). The state is tracked and managed in the [state schema](/vircadia-world/cli/database/migration/#5-state).

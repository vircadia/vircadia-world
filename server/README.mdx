## World API Manager

## World Tick Manager

## PostgreSQL

The PostgreSQL service runs a vanilla PostgreSQL instance, this serves as the primary data store for your game.

## PGWeb

## API Endpoints and Connection

The Vircadia World server exposes both REST and WebSocket endpoints for client-server communication. These endpoints are defined in the schema and can be accessed programmatically.

### REST API

The REST API is available at the base path `/world/rest`. Available endpoints include:

- Session validation: `POST /world/rest/session/validate`
- Service stats: `GET /stats`

### WebSocket API

The WebSocket connection is established by upgrading a connection at `/world/ws`. The WebSocket API supports these message types:

- Query requests and responses
- Tick notifications
- Error responses

For detailed information on connecting to these endpoints and available APIs, see the [API Reference](/vircadia-world/server/api-reference) documentation.
